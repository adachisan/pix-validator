This repository is a testing ground for methods to validate Brazilian payment system 'pix', providing a set of tools to ease the process of validating transactions.

Since pix's api is not available for non financial companies, i must find another ways to validade transactions for person to person.

In Brazil there is a lot of scams beacause of this lack of validation, because both clients must to validade their transactions manually on their bank's system.
